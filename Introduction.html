first coding lesson.I hope this will all turn out okay. I am very very excited because coding is something I've wanted
to do for the longest time especially considering I want to pursue software engineering this is an early start off which
is good.Anyway I'm just gonna trust the process and wait to see how this turns out.Hopefully by the end of this I'll
have acquired some pretty mad skills in coding.Cant wait to take over the tech world cause one thing's for sure there
aren't enough women in the tech world.To the beginning of a beautiful journey. I cant wait to see what this journey has
in store for me.
